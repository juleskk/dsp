[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

This problems asks one to compute summary statistics for birthweight, comparing first children to others. To solve the problem, I calculated the mean using pandas and Cohen's *d* statistic using the formula in the book. 

On average, first babies are 0.12 lbs lighter than others, a difference of .089 standard deviations. Although first children tend to be lighter, mean pregnancy length for firsts babies is slightly higher at 38.601 weeks as compared to 38.523 weeks (sd of .029).
