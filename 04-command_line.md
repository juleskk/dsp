What does `ls` do? What do `ls -a`, `ls -l`, and `ls -lh` do? What combinations of those flags are meaningful?

'ls' lists the contents of a directory

'ls -l' lists files in long format

'ls -a' lists all files, including those that are invisible files 

'ls -lh' prints long format files in a human readable format 

All permutations of 'l' 'a' and 'h' are meaningful.
